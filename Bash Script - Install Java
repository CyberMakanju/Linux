Write a bash script using Vim editor that installs the latest Java version and checks whether Java was installed successfully by executing a Java -version command.

After the installation command, it checks 3 conditions:

1. Whether Java is installed at all
2. whether an older Java version is installed (java version lower than 11)
3. whether a Java version of 11 or higher was installed



1.	Open Vim Editor:

The script in Vim:
#!/bin/bash

# Update Package index
sudo apt update

# Install the latest Java version
sudo apt install -y default-jdk

# Check Java installation
java -version &> /dev/null
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Java is not installed."
    exit 1
else
    java_version=$(java -version 2>&1 | awk -F[\"_] '/version/ {print $2}')
    echo "Java version: $java_version"

    # Check if the installed Java version is lower than 11
    if [[ "$java_version" < "11" ]]; then
        echo "An older Java version (lower than 11) is installed."
    else
        echo "Java version 11 or higher is installed."
    fi
fi

Explanation:

	•	The script first updates the package index using sudo apt update.
	•	It then installs the latest Java Development Kit (JDK) using sudo apt install -y default-jdk.
	•	The script checks if Java is installed by executing the Java -version and checking the exit status ($?).
	•	If Java is not installed, it prints a message and exits with a status code of 1.
	•	If Java is installed, it retrieves the Java version using awk to parse the output of the Java -version.
	•	It then compares the Java version to determine if it is lower than 11 or 11 and higher, printing the appropriate message.

This script ensures that the latest version of Java is installed and verifies the installation by checking the version of Java installed on the system.
