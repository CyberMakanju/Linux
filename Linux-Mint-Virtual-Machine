1. Create a Linux Mint Virtual Machine

Prerequisites:

	•	Install VMware or any other virtualization software.
	•	Download the Linux Mint ISO from the official website.

Steps:

	1.	Open VirtualBox:
	•	Launch VirtualBox and click on “New” to create a new virtual machine.
	2.	Name and Operating System:
	•	Name your VM (e.g., “Linux Mint”).
	•	Set the type to “Linux” and the version to “Ubuntu (64-bit)”.
	3.	Memory Size:
	•	Allocate memory (RAM) for your VM. 2GB (2048 MB) is a good starting point.
	4.	Hard Disk:
	•	Create a virtual hard disk. Choose “VDI” (VirtualBox Disk Image).
	•	Choose “Dynamically allocated” or “Fixed size” as per your preference.
	•	Allocate at least 20GB of storage.
	5.	Start the VM:
	•	Start the VM and select the Linux Mint ISO file as the startup disk.
	6.	Install Linux Mint:
	•	Follow the on-screen instructions to install Linux Mint on your VM.
Check Distribution:

$lsb_release -a

# No LSB modules are available.
# Distributor ID: Linuxmint
# Description:    Linux Mint 21.3
# Release:        21.3
# Codename:       Virginia

Check Package Manager:

Linux Mint uses apt as its package manager. You can verify this by running:
which apt
# /usr/bin/apt

3. Check CLI Editor
Check Installed Editors:
nano --version
# GNU nano, version 6.2
vi --version
# VIM - Vi IMproved 8.2
vim --version
# VIM - Vi IMproved 8.2
By default, Nano is typically configured as the default editor in Linux Mint


4. Check Software Center/Manager

Linux Mint uses the “Software Manager” (mintinstall) for its software center.
which mintinstall
# /usr/bin/mintinstall

5. Check Default Shell
The default shell for the user is usually Bash.
echo $SHELL
# /bin/bash
